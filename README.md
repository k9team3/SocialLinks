**A Simple Transform to find all Members in a Facebook Group or  a Google+ Person using the Maltego Software.**

You need to create a Seed on the Public iTDS from Maltego and build the Transforms connecting to your Server.  
You can use the provided Entites.

Please add your own Facebook App - Secret and App-ID  and Google Key in /config/config.php !  
You need a GroupID ( Example: 381517268582459) to search for the Members.  
Maltego Commercial will only return 12 Entities , so dont' worry.
